# Drive API

* Create a dedicated Drive folder to store your applicationâ€™s data so that the app cannot access all the user's content stored in Google Drive.

*   Integrate with the Google Drive UI

* for some reason through web user interface, if you give the api key once, and you give an empty string again for the API key, the api key still works how should I go about reporting this
