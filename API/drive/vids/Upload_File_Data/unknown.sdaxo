The debate is over. LeBron James is the greatest basketball player in history. His closest competitor, Michael Jordan, has been vanquished.
Not everyone agrees—Jordan still has many defenders. But that’s only because human beings are slow to let go of once-revered truths. What these resisters have in common is a general refusal to examine the advanced statistics carefully. They rely, instead, on vague, quasi-metaphysical concepts such as “indomitable will” and “relentless desire to win.” Jordan, we are assured, would eat nails, break concrete, leap monster-filled motes, and much more just to win a game. LeBron, on the other hand, stuffs the stats sheet but lacks Jordan’s killer instinct when it matters most. Why else would Jordan be 6 for 6 in NBA Finals and LeBron a paltry 3 for 9?
One of the great things about sports is we can quantify nebulous concepts. If Jordan really had an indomitable will to win that made him more “clutch” than LeBron, then that would show up in the statistics. But the cold, hard facts—as opposed to vague, poetic attributes—point to LeBron being the GOAT (for a balanced take that instead leans Jordan, see here).
Call me a positivist about basketball. Like everyone else, I’m vulnerable to nostalgia and narrative. But I discipline my biases with data. And the data tell an incontrovertible story: LeBron James has been more valuable than Michael Jordan, both in the regular season and in the playoffs. Consequently, LeBron, not Jordan, is the greatest player in NBA history. He is also the greatest playoff player in history. When winning most mattered, he added the most value to his teams.
